Ambulance booking App
Welcome to AmbuGet â€“ your revolutionary web application designed to connect passengers, drivers, and administrators seamlessly in times of medical emergencies. In this innovative platform, we cater to three distinct user types: passengers, drivers and administrators, each with specific functionalities to enhance the overall emergency response experience.

Passenger Experience:
Passengers have the power to make a difference in critical situations. By signing up and registering as blood donors, they contribute to the larger cause of saving lives. In addition to their altruistic endeavors, passengers can also request various types of ambulance services, including ICU, General, Isolation and Freezing Van. Our platform ensures swift and efficient matching with the nearest available drivers, ensuring timely and life-saving responses.

Driver's Role:
Drivers play a pivotal role in the AmbuGet ecosystem. Upon registration, they become an integral part of the emergency response network. Drivers have the responsibility to receive and respond to passenger requests promptly. Simultaneously, they can also explore opportunities to contribute by signing up as blood donors. This dual functionality emphasizes the shared responsibility of both passengers and drivers in creating a robust and interconnected emergency response community.

Blood Donor Matching:
Both passengers and drivers have the capability to search for blood donors within the AmbuGet community. This feature fosters a collaborative environment where users can actively participate in addressing urgent blood requirements. By connecting donors with those in need, AmbuGet ensures that every user has the potential to make a life-saving impact.

Admin Insights:
The administrator panel provides an insightful overview of blood requirements through comprehensive graphs. Admins can visualize and analyze data related to blood needs, helping in strategic planning and resource allocation. This feature enhances the efficiency of emergency response efforts by empowering administrators with data-driven decision-making capabilities.

Important Note:
As this is a prototype, please be aware that the "maps javascript API" key from Google Cloud Console, used to locate the nearest ambulance services, has not been integrated. Rest assured, in the final version, this crucial element will enhance the precision and accuracy of the emergency response system, ensuring optimal user experience.
